			U2FS - STACKABLE UNIFICATION FILE SYSTEM

INSTALLATION: 
-------------
 1. Make kernel using kernel.config provided in hw2 OR set CONFIG_U2_FS=m to .config file and do a make
 2. From hw2-amittal directory run 
 				insmod fs/u2fs.ko
 3. Create a left directory and a right directory
 4. Mount the file system using
 	mount -t u2fs -o ldir=<left_dir>,rdir=<right_dir> null /mnt/u2fs     #/mnt/u2fs should exists
 5. Now you can cd to /mnt/u2fs and issue normal file system commands

DESIGN:
-------
 - WRAPFS was copied to new directory fs/u2fs and changes were made to create a loadable filesystem module.
 - Then most of the code was ported from UNIONFS and changed as per requirement.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
-----------------
 - U2FS dentry contains left and right path.
 - U2FS inode contains just one lower inode as we jut need to store valid one. the low priority one can be accessed from The dentry node.
 - U2FS superblock contains pointers toleft and right superblock.
 - U2FS File contains pointer to left and right file.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------
 - File Lookup
 	To compile custom ls - do a make in hw2/coreutils, then run hw2/coreutils/src/ls as you will execute normal ls.
	ls file was changed in hw2/coreutils/src/ls.c
 - File Creation	
 - Modifying Files	
 - File Deletion	
 - file operations: cp, cat, less, stat, df, symlink, chmod
 - partially implemented(ie does not work when right branch is involved) : mv, link, rmdir

 EXTRA CREDITS:
 --------------
 1. Usekernel.config.ec present in hw2 directory or set CONFIG_U2_DUP_ELIMINATION=y in .config file and then do a make and install module and mount it.
 2. Now normal ls won't show duplicate entries.
 3. The code can be found in 'file.c' in u2fs_filldir function.
